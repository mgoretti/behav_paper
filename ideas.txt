ideas:
cooperation reached vs p(coop)^2 (0.9*0.9 => 0.81?)
ex-ante coop (first round)

p coop and cooperation reached in those conditions
{
  coop reaction (second, third round after coop in the previous round)
  uncooperation reaction (second, third round after both did not cooperate)
  owned reaction (second, third round after p1 cooperated and p2 did not (worst outcome for p1))
}

final reaction as a standalone (selfish individuals or inequity averse?)

standard MM, FF, MF behaviour?

SES significance?
